# HW2_Git_and_python

We have written a mini-program `calculator.py `. The program accepts input (via `input()`) a string with some mathematical expression and prints a number - the result of calculating this expression. 
The expression must consist of two numbers (`int` or `float`) and a mathematical operator between them (one of 4: `+ - * /`). All the specified elements are separated by spaces (example: `5 - 3`). 

There are 5 functions implemented inside the script: `main' (which accepts the input expression) and 4 functions for each type of mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).
